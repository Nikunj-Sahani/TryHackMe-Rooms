        >> 217.160.0.152
             Hint :: You may need to answer question 4 first and use that switch to resolve the IPv4 address of the site, rather than the IPv6 address.

   \3/ What switch lets you change the interval of sent ping requests?
        >> -i
              Hint :: Look in the man page
